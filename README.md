# DisneyPlusRipPack

A pack I made that allows me to rip Movies and TV Shows from Disney+

(Could work on other sites that use Widevine - I haven't tried)

## Installation

- Clone or download the zip

- Extract the 2 zips and add them as extensions into chrome

- Go to Disney+ and press **CTRL-SHIFT-I** and go to console - Leave this tab open

-  Start the stream of whatever content you want to rip - you should see a message in the console giving a **KEY** and a **KID**

- Open the Stream Detector and click on the text that starts with crtl-all **(If there are more than 1 links, Hover over them, and copy the one with the domain media.dssott.com)**

- Open Disney.bat and paste the link when asked to, and enter the **KEY** and the **KID** - The script should then start downloading and decrypting your content.
